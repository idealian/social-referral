Social referral
===============

A system to entice users through incentives to refer offers to their friends via social networks. The offers will have further incentives to encourage those referees to accept the offer as well as continue to refer friends in their social networks. The process continues on to third, fourth, and so on, degree of social connection; thereby creating a rapid, self subsisting referral system.

An integrated url shortener will facilitate sharing and tracking of offer referrals.
